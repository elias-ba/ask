```

## Data Analysis

### CSV Files

```bash

cat metrics.csv | ask "detect any unusual patterns in this data"

# Generate reports
cat data.csv | ask "create a summary report with key insights"
```

### JSON Processing

```bash
# Query complex JSON
cat api_response.json | ask "extract all user emails where status is active"

# Validate structure
ask "is this valid JSON and what structure does it have?" < data.json

# Transform data
cat input.json | ask "convert this to CSV format"
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Error patterns
cat app.log | ask "group errors by type and show frequency"

# Performance metrics
cat access.log | ask "calculate average response time by endpoint"

# Security audit
cat auth.log | ask "find suspicious login attempts"
```

## Security & Compliance

### Security Checks

```bash

## Pro Tips

### Context Awareness

```bash
# Use context levels strategically
ask --context min "quick question"     # Fast, minimal context
ask --context auto "debug this"        # Balanced (default)
ask --context full "complex analysis"  # Maximum context
```

### Chaining Commands

```bash
# Multi-step pipeline
git diff | ask "summarize changes" | ask "suggest commit message"

# Complex workflows
find . -name "*.js" | xargs cat | ask "find code smells"
```

### Combining with Tools

```bash
# With fzf
ask "list all git commands" | fzf

# With watch
watch -n 60 "docker ps | ask 'are there issues?'"

# With cron
0 */4 * * * ask --agent "cleanup old logs" >> /var/log/ask.log
```

### Model Selection

```bash
# Fast responses
ask -m gpt-4o-mini "quick question"

# Complex reasoning
ask -m claude-opus-4 "design a system architecture"

# Cost-effective
ask -m gpt-3.5-turbo "simple task"
```

### Saving Conversations

```bash
# Important discussions
ask "complex topic"
# ... conversation ...
ask --save  # Save for later

# Resume later
ask --load  # Continue conversation
```

## Learning & Documentation

```bash
# Understand complex commands
ask "explain: find . -type f -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -delete"

# Shell scripting help
ask "how does parameter expansion work in bash?"

# Git workflows
ask "explain git rebase vs merge with examples"
```

### Generate Documentation

```bash
# Code documentation
cat myfunction.py | ask "generate docstring for this function"

# README generation
ask "create a README for this project" --context full

# API documentation
ask "document this REST API" < api_routes.js
```

### Quick References

```bash
# Command syntax
ask "show me grep examples for common use cases"

# Best practices
ask "what are bash scripting best practices?"

# Cheat sheets
ask "give me a jq cheat sheet"
```

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Routine

```bash
# Check system health
ask --context full "daily system health check"

# Review git status
git status | ask "summarize what I was working on"

# Plan work
ask "based on my recent commits, what should I focus on today?"
```

### Code Review Workflow

```bash

# 2. Review
ask "code review this PR" < /tmp/pr.diff

# 3. Test suggestions
ask "suggest test cases for this PR" < /tmp/pr.diff

# 4. Documentation check
ask "does this PR need documentation updates?" < /tmp/pr.diff
```

### Debugging Workflow

```bash
# 1. Capture error
./myapp 2>&1 | tee error.log

# 2. Initial analysis
